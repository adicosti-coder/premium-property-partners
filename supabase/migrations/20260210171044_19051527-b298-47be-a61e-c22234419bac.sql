-- Fix: Tighten profiles SELECT policy to authenticated users only (own profile)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON public.profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile"
  ON public.profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Also tighten INSERT and UPDATE to authenticated
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile"
  ON public.profiles
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON public.profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile"
  ON public.profiles
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Add admin SELECT policy for profiles management
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all profiles"
  ON public.profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (public.has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role));
